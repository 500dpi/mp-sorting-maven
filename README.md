## Mini-Project #8: Sorting Algorithms

### Authors

### Overview

Four traditional sorting algorithms:

- Insertion sort: Swap an unsorted element into the last sorted portion of the collection,
then compare the new element to the sorted portion to find the correct sorted position.

- Selection sort: Find the next smallest element and swap with the first unsorted element.

- Merge sort: Divide the collection in half, then continue to divide the collections until they
are singletons; re-combine the initial halves of the collection.

- Quicksort: uses a pivot point to divide an conquer subarrays.

Along with an additional created algorithm:

- An algorithm that sorts using a modified Merge sort that limits uncessary calls to merge already-sorted arrays + switches to insertion sort when the array is less than 60 elements.
