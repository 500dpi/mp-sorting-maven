### Overview

Four traditional sorting algorithms:

- Insertion sort: Swap an unsorted element into the next sorted portion of the collection,
then compare the new element to the sorted portion to find the correct sorted position.

- Selection sort: Find the next element smallest element and swap with the first unsorted element.

- Merge sort: Divide the collection in half, then continue to divide the collections until they
are singletons that are divided in order of smaller->larger; sort them, then re-combine the initial
halves of the collection.

- Quicksort: Like merge sort, except the initial division is done at a ranodmly-selected pivot point.

Along with an additional created algorithm:
